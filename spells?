mplementing magic spells can range from simple to complex, depending on the mechanics and visual effects you want to achieve. Here are some relatively easy spells to implement in a raycasting engine:

Projectile Spell: Create a basic spell that shoots a projectile (e.g., fireball, ice shard) from the player's position in the direction they are facing. When the projectile collides with a wall or an enemy, apply damage and show a basic impact effect (e.g., a small explosion or particle burst).

Healing Spell: Implement a healing spell that restores the player's health when activated. This spell could be a simple instant heal or gradually heal the player over time.

Light/Darkness Spell: Add a spell that toggles between "light" and "darkness" modes. In "light" mode, visibility is improved, and in "darkness" mode, visibility is reduced. This can be achieved by adjusting the ambient light in the scene.

Teleportation Spell: Create a teleportation spell that allows the player to instantly move to a predefined location in the map. Make sure to check for obstructions before teleporting.

Shield Spell: Implement a spell that creates a temporary shield around the player, reducing incoming damage for a certain duration.

Summoning Spell: Add a summoning spell that spawns a temporary ally or creature to fight alongside the player. Keep the behavior of the summoned entity simple, such as having it follow the player and attack nearby enemies.

Freezing Spell: Create a spell that freezes enemies on impact, preventing them from moving for a short period.

Fire Area-of-Effect (AoE) Spell: Design a spell that creates a fire AoE on the ground where the player aims. Any enemies or objects within the area take damage over time.

Invisibility Spell: Implement a spell that temporarily makes the player invisible to enemies, allowing them to move undetected for a short duration.

Speed Boost Spell: Create a spell that temporarily boosts the player's movement speed, allowing them to move faster for a limited time.

Remember to start with a basic version of each spell and gradually add more complexity and polish as you become more comfortable with the mechanics. Also, consider how these spells interact with the game world and other elements like enemies, obstacles, and the player's abilities. Playtesting and balancing are
